Perfect! Here's the final and complete project document for your hackathon, now titled ChalkBox — incorporating every key component: vision, tech, features, Prisma data models, ML suggestions, smart contracts, gamification, and more.

📌 Project Title
ChalkBox – Empowering Nepali Students to Learn, Teach, and Earn

🎯 Project Objective
Build a student-first digital platform where Nepali high school and college students can:
📌 Showcase their skills and portfolios


🎓 Teach live workshops and earn platform tokens


💼 Access verified job and internship opportunities


🔐 Use blockchain-based smart contracts for trust and fairness


🧠 Get ML-based personalized suggestions for  jobs and workshops


🏆 Earn gamified badges rooted in Nepali culture



🔍 Problem Addressed
Nepali students face:
❌ Lack of real-world exposure during education


❌ Unpaid or exploitative internships


❌ Minimal part-time hiring in the local market


❌ No easy way to monetize or showcase skills early


Meanwhile, the government aims to promote 20 hours/week of part-time work, but platforms are missing.

💡 Proposed Solution: ChalkBox
A web platform where:
Students create profiles, list skills, and find work


They can host or attend live workshops (via Zoom)


Employers post verified gigs and internships


All job agreements are logged on the blockchain for transparency


Platform tokens are rewarded for contributions (non-crypto)


AI/ML recommends next-step workshops and matching jobs


Peer reviews + gamified badge system (e.g., Guru, Acharya) build community trust



🧱 Tech Stack
Layer
Tech Used
Frontend
React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend
Node.js, Express.js
Database
MongoDB via Prisma
ORM
Prisma (MongoDB-compatible schema)
Blockchain
Polygon Mumbai Testnet (only smart contracts)
ML Matching
Python (Flask) or simple Node-based TF-IDF
Hosting
Vercel / Render / Railway
Payments
Not in scope (no eSewa/Khalti yet)
Dev Tools
GitHub, Postman, Prisma Studio


🧠 Key Features
🔹 User Roles
Student – Create profile, apply to jobs, teach/join workshops


Employer – Post jobs, hire verified students


Admin – Moderate, verify companies, manage reviews/disputes



🔹 Modules Breakdown
Module
Description
Authentication
JWT-based login/register with role-based access
Student Profile
Skills, bio, portfolio, badges, tokens earned
Job Board
Verified jobs & internships, with smart contract upon acceptance
Smart Contracts
Immutable agreement hash logged on Polygon (no tokens, no crypto)
Workshop Hosting
Zoom-based sessions with peer reviews & token earnings
Workshop Reviews
Attendees review hosts; affects ratings, trust & badge levels
Badging System
Culturally themed levels: Shiksharthi → Guru → Acharya
Token System
Non-crypto points earned for activities (e.g., teaching, reviewing)
ML Matching
Suggest jobs/workshops based on skills, learning paths, and peer activity
Featured Workshops
Personalized learning suggestions (e.g., “Next skill after MERN: Docker”)
Admin Panel
View reports, flag abuse, verify employers


🛠️ Data Modeling (Prisma + MongoDB)
Key models include:
User (role, skills, tokens, badges)


Job (tags, requiredSkills, employer)


Workshop (skillsTaught, Zoom link, host)


Application (student proposals)


Contract (agreement hashes, linked to job and users)


Review (workshop or job rating)


Badge (name, icon, description)


📎 Full schema already generated and can be imported into your repo.

🔗 Blockchain Usage (Non-Crypto)
Use Case
How Blockchain is Used
Job Agreement
Hash stored on Polygon Mumbai
Work Delivery Verification
File hashes stored on chain
Review Integrity
Ratings stored immutably for transparency
No Token Transfers
Just data hashes, no wallets needed


🤖 ML Personalization Layer
Matches students to jobs using:


Skill overlap (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)


NLP on job descriptions vs student profile


Recommends workshops to “level up” based on skill trees:


MERN → Docker → AWS


Design → Figma → Freelancing


System learns what other top students are learning and promotes accordingly



🏅 Gamification – Badges & Tokens
Badge Name
Criteria
Shiksharthi
Joined platform, completed first activity
Sikshya-sevi
Hosted 1+ workshops
Guru
10+ 5-star peer reviews on workshops
Acharya
Admin-verified top mentor level
Utsaahi Intern
Completed 3+ contracts

➡️ Badges stored in the user profile and shown on the dashboard.

💥 Why ChalkBox Stands Out
✅ Tailored for Nepali students’ reality
 ✅ Peer-to-peer education + income model
 ✅ Trust via blockchain-backed contracts
 ✅ Intelligent matching via ML/NLP
 ✅ Culturally localized gamification
 ✅ Aligned with government policy on student work hours
 ✅ Scalable into a real product post-hackathon
